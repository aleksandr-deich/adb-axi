# adb-axi

An agent-friendly command-line wrapper around adb, following the AXI conventions: token-efficient output, truthful exit codes, deadlines on every device call, and structured errors.

It covers the device-state side of Android work: device health, app lifecycle including process-death checks, run-scoped logs and crashes, and app data. UI driving is out of scope.

**Status:** in development. This 0.0.1 release reserves the name and contains no commands yet.
